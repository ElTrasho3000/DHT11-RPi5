# DHT11-RPi5

This Code uses the standard gpiod-library
to read data from DHT11-sensor on a RaspberryPi5.

It is largely based on the
[Adafruit DHT-library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library). Yet for now it only supports reading temperature in degrees celcius and humidity in percent.</br>
Adafruit published their library under MIT License.
